~~ Understand the problem ~~
----------------------------
1. Can I repeat the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs expected from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined by the inputs?
5. How should the important pieces of data be labeled?

/*
~~ Make Examples ~~
--------------------
1. Start with simple examples
2. progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs

/*
~~ Solve or simplify ~~
-----------------------
Solve the problem. If you cant - solve a simpler problem:
- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
- Break it down to smaller problems
OR
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Incorporate the difficulty back in
