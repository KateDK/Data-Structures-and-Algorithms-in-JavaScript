~~ Understand the problem ~~
----------------------------
1. Can I repeat the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the probkem?
3. What are the outputs expected from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined by the inputs?
5. How should the importent pieces of data be labled?

/*
~~ Make Examples ~~
--------------------
1. Start with simple examples
2. progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs
*/

/*
~~ Break it down ~~
--------------------
Think about the steps needed to solve the problem
*/

/*
~~ Solve or simplify ~~
-----------------------
Splve the problem. If you cant - solve a simpler problem:
- Find the core dificulty in what you're trying to do.
- Break it down to smaller problems
OR
- Temporarily ignore that dificulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Incorprate the dificulkty back in
