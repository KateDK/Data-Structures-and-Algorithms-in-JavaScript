/**
 * Big O is a system that allows us to evaluate fow efficient our code is (in terms of run time or space).
 *
 * Why is big O important:
 * - Having a unified language on performance helps us understand and communicate to others about our code.
 * - Big O can be helpful when thinking about trade-offs about our code.
 * - Can help us identify pain points in our code.
 * - Big O can come up in interviews
